        <h1 style="font-size:2.2vw">Introduction to OpenBSD</h1>
        <div>
            <p>OpenBSD is a security-focused, free and open-source, Unix-like operating system based on the Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD). Theo de Raadt created OpenBSD in 1995 by forking NetBSD 1.0.[4] According to the website, the OpenBSD project emphasizes "portability, standardization, correctness, proactive security and integrated cryptography."</p>
        </div>
		        <h1 style="font-size:1.1vw">Special features of OpenBSD:</h1>
        <div>
            <p>Assume you have a server running a different operating system than OpenBSD that has been hacked through SQL injection. The attacker may cause havoc on the system if that SQL server was operating as a normal user. The user www, a restricted account, operates OpenBSD's built-in web server. It is also operated within a chroot prison. Finally, it is executed using a shell that does not allow logins. The attacker does not even have access to a shell prompt from which to perform commands. 
				Other operating systems allow chroots, although they are seldom, if ever, used by default.
				[chroot: chroot works by​​ changing the root directory of a program, restricting access and visibility, and thus providing an added layer of isolation and security.]</p>
			</div>
			
		  <h1 style="font-size:1.1vw">Write XOR Execute:</h1>
        <div>
            <p>The next security feature pioneered by OpenBSD is known as write XOR execute (W X). A process's or the kernel's address space can be readable or executable, but not both. In 2003, OpenBSD was the first operating system to include this capability in version 3.3.</p>
        </div>
		 <h1 style="font-size:1.1vw">Guard Pages:</h1>
        <div>
            <p>Similarly, guard pages were incorporated into OpenBSD in 2003. Guard pages insert an unreadable and unwritable page in memory at the end of each page of memory to detect overruns.</p>
        </div>
		<h1 style="font-size:1.1vw">Address Space Randomization: </h1>
        <div>
            <p>This feature eliminates the need for code to be in the same location each time a programme executes. An attacker cannot access data by using a known offset. </p>
			<p>Let's imagine you have two programmes, A and B. If programme B has a memory leak and attackers know that programme A is loaded before B in memory, they can use the vulnerability in programme B to crash programme A by writing to its memory area.</p>
			<p>If programme A starts before programme B by default, this does not imply that B will follow A in memory. In reality, a wide gap between the two programmes may be created, or programme C could be inserted between A and B. Even if a third-party piece of software, such as an Apache web server, contains a fault, crashing it does not allow the attacker to exploit anything.</p>
        </div>
		<h1 style="font-size:1.1vw">Pledge and Unveil:</h1>
        <div>
            <p>Pledge and Unveil are two sides of the same coin: Pledge is used to limit filesystem access, while Unveil is used to limit system calls. The unique pairing of Pledge and Unveil makes it difficult to meaningfully compromise a programme. Even if a programme is compromised, the hacker can only write to one file or directory, or call certain systems.</p>

            <p>Once you've selected a mirror, you will be brought to a page with several directories. To download the most recent disk image, select the highest release number. The "7.3" folder should include the most recently updated version as of 7th April 2023, but if you see anything newer, use that.</p>

            <p>On the Hard disc stage, select "Create a virtual hard disc now." Because OpenBSD will need to be installed within the virtual system, a virtual hard drive will be required. Select "Create."</p>

            <h2 class = "two">Step 8:</h2>
            <img src="img/8.jpeg" alt="Step 3 Image">
            <p>The following option is to use a dynamically allocated or fixed size virtual hard disc. For most people, "Dynamically allocated" is the easiest to use because it requires the least amount of setting. Click "Continue."</p>

		<div class="step">
            <h2 class = "two">Step 9:</h2>
            <img src="img/9.jpeg" alt="Step 3 Image">
            <p>Finally, the maximum size and location of the virtual hard disc can be specified. This might be an external hard disc or a specific location on a local hard drive. Because the size is the maximum size to which the virtual hard drive may develop, it may be wise to restrict this amount if there are significant size constraints based on hard disc capacity. Because the base OpenBSD installation would be modest, this restriction might simply be adjusted to a few GB. Select an option and click "Create."</p>

            <img src="img/15.jpeg" alt="Step 3 Image">
            <p>The following questions concern network setup. The network settings in a virtual computer are pretty straightforward to configure. As the default network setup settings should be sufficient for most users, each option, beginning with Available network interfaces and ending with DNS domain name, can be responded to by just clicking Enter. Depending on your network arrangement, it may be worth taking greater caution when selecting these parameters during a hardware installation.</p>
        </div>

            <h2 class = "two">Step 17:</h2>
            <img src="img/16.jpeg" alt="Step 3 Image">
            <p>The following option, Password for root account, allows the root password to be specified. The "will not echo" string indicates that the password will not be displayed when entered, nor will it be returned to the user. In general, the root password should be strong, especially for a server or internet-connected machine.</p>
        </div>
		<div class="step">
            <h2 class = "two">Step 18:</h2>
            <img src="img/17.jpeg" alt="Step 3 Image">
            <p>The installer asks if you want to start the SSH daemon, or background service, by default after you input the root password twice. While not required, it may be beneficial. Enter to activate it.</p>
        </div>
		<div class="step">
            <h2 class = "two">Step 19:</h2>
            <img src="img/18.jpeg" alt="Step 3 Image">
            <p>The following two questions regard the graphical configuration of the system. If you'd like to use a graphical interface, enable the X Window System by pressing Enter. The next question asks if you would like the X Window System to be started by the xenodm login manager. While this isn't necessary, it will make installing a different desktop environment easier, as shown later in this tutorial. To enable it, type yes and press Enter.</p>
        </div>

            <h2 class = "two">Step 20:</h2>
            <img src="img/19.jpeg" alt="Step 3 Image">
            <p>Then, for a standard-level user, provide a name and password. Because it is advisable not to operate as the root user for security concerns, this user will be utilised for most common desktop functions. For most users, blocking root SSH login is also a good idea for security reasons.</p>

            <p>Then, the installer will partition the disks. In general, the only disk available for the virtual machine will be fine for the installation — click Enter.</p>
